# NetGoat  

NetGoat is a deliberately insecure web application built with C# and ASP.NET, inspired by OWASP WebGoat.  
It is designed to demonstrate common security vulnerabilities on both the server and client sides,  
allowing developers and security professionals to learn about web application security through hands-on practice.  

## WARNING  
This application contains known vulnerabilities and should only be run in a controlled environment.  
Do not expose it to the internet or use it on a production system.  

## Security Scanning with Semgrep  

As part of NetGoat, we are developing **Semgrep rules** to detect security vulnerabilities at the source code level.  
These rules will help identify common flaws within ASP.NET applications, providing a practical approach to secure coding.
